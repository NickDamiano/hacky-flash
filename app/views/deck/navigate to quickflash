To do Sunday
	


	assign the down key to pull down another card
	maybe spacebar deletes the card
	assign the number keys 1-5 or something like that to push that card into a 
	   custom pile and create one if it doesn't exist (build out idea more)
	when up key is pressed and card is discarded, automatically draw one from the main stack

	create review 
		once main deck and active deck are depleted, review mode starts
		event is triggered and cards are placed in center
		up puts it for review
		down pulls it into discard pile
		when deck is empty, event triggered and review is loaded into main deck
		study goes back to normal
		(how do you get keypress events to only bind during certain events?)

later
	make it so you can upload and download decks with csv excel
	make it so you can log in and save decks
	able to edit, merge, delete decks from the select page
	styling!
	security!
	move javascript to appropriate files
