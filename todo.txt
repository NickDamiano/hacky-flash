Fuck. I can see the @cards when i use byebug. but when i pull it from the data attribute
using jquery it's an empty string. WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK. 

Maybe it needs to redirect to a modify deck page at which point it can populate the page with the ruby and then after changes are done, it puts it into json into the localstorage:




the id 'one_card' is cloned and then each card has the same id, but shouldn't we only have one id per element? Should this be a clone of the first element of a class called one_card?

- make a view and load partials. so the view has the header with navigation bars on top. so we can select a different deck. create a new one etc. 

- make routes for editing decks that one thing...where its like /deck/edit/123

- add excel csv importer that takes it and populates local storage with the decks

- figure out review mode

- add a thing to convert the local storage into a csv file to be downloaded. 

- review deck needs to be stringified and stored into local storage when it's time to review

- possibly deck can be saved after review session 

- needs to be a place where you manage all cards and delete the ones you don't want or add ones you do. 

- Move Javascript into separate files (problem before was that - we only wanted certain javascript to load for certain pages)

- rather than having to click each translate button, we should have one translate for all so you can either translate all or 1 at a time, or if the field on the right is not empty, it leaves that alone and translates the rest. 





PHASE 1: initial decks selected for study and put into one big pile

PHASE 2: student reviews cards until they feel good and the deck is empty. so it is supposed that they know all cards 

PHASE 3: student reviews all the cards once more and divides them into two piles. pile 1 for cards they realize they don't know. pile 2 for cards they feel good about even after review that will not be studied again this session.

PHASE 4: all cards have been filtered so we repeat phase 2 with the review cards being placed in the active deck

PHASE 5: alternates again to phase 3 for review break

once no more cards have been added into review mode, the study session ends.
